I made a project , webscraping using python and flask. The project name is " Product Recommendation System implementing Bi-Parametric Linear Algebraic Normalization using 
Python,". First I make a frontend (client), using html,css, after that I using flask for creating a server, and using python  for scraping the websites,after that using an algorithm for the product normalisation. Then connect frontend with the server for client search queries, after that the search product shown into the client.
